      <description>Hello again! Going along with the theme of agressive games, here&amp;rsquo;s a game I recently finished on chess.com where I made a positional blunder that allowed my opponent to win in a strong, agressive style.
CCT Passed Pawn QF R1: Board 15  The opening is a typical Caro-Kann advance variation, which tends to look more like the French defense because the c6-pawn was pushed to c5. The main difference from the French defense, though, is that the light squared bishop is not trapped behind its pawns.</description>

      <description>Until a few months ago, I used to have the problem of being materialistic in chess. I&amp;rsquo;d focus on gaining a pawn advantage and making that my only goal in my chess games, after which I would just try to simplify the position until I won. However, after you reach about a 1200 USCF rating, you will lose terribly if you neglect the other aspects of chess. King safety, protecting yourself.</description>

      <description>Hello, my friends! Today, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share about an interesting chess game from the PennApps hackathon with you. The chess tournament was held at the UPenn, and people from the PennApps hackathon as well as the UPenn chess club competed together in one tournament. It was a blitz tournament, with an 8|0 time control (yes, eight minutes - I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why), so the moves and ideas from the following game are from memory and not notated.</description>
