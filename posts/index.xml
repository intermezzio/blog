      <description>Until a few months ago, I used to have the problem of being materialistic in chess. I&amp;rsquo;d focus on gaining a pawn advantage and making that my only goal in my chess games, after which I would just try to simplify the position until I won. However, after you reach about a 1200 USCF rating, you will lose terribly if you neglect the other aspects of chess. King safety, protecting yourself.</description>

      <description>Hello, my friends! Today, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share about an interesting chess game from the PennApps hackathon with you. The chess tournament was held at the UPenn, and people from the PennApps hackathon as well as the UPenn chess club competed together in one tournament. It was a blitz tournament, with an 8|0 time control (yes, eight minutes - I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why), so the moves and ideas from the following game are from memory and not notated.</description>
