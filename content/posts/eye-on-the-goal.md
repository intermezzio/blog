Until a few months ago, I used to have the problem of being materialistic in chess.  I'd focus on gaining a pawn advantage and making that my only goal in my chess games, after which I would just try to simplify the position until I won.  However, after you reach about a 1200 USCF rating, you will lose terribly if you neglect the other aspects of chess.  King safety, protecting yourself.  Positional chess, making your pieces worth more than your opponent's pieces.  And finally, attacking, focusing on taking the opponent's king.

However, in the last few months, I have played several attacking games on chess.com, and this is one of my favorites.

To briefly review the opening, (#14) I (as white) take control of the center with pawns on e4 and d4, and black attempts to control it with a fianchettoed bishop on g7 and a possbile pawn break on d5 or c5.
