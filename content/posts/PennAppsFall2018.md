Hello, my friends!  Today, I'd like to share about an interesting chess game from the PennApps hackathon with you.  The chess tournament was held at the UPenn, and people from the PennApps hackathon as well as the UPenn chess club competed together in one tournament.  I'm rated at approximately 1400 USCF, and the game I'm sharing with you was against a 2200 USCF rated player.  The game started out with one of my favorite openings, the Budapest Gambit.  The game started with 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. Nh3
