Hello, my friends!  Today, I'd like to share about an interesting chess game from the PennApps hackathon with you.  The chess tournament was held at the UPenn, and people from the PennApps hackathon as well as the UPenn chess club competed together in one tournament.  I'm rated at approximately 1400 USCF, and the game I'm sharing with you was against a 2200 USCF rated player.  The game started out with one of my favorite openings, the Budapest Gambit.  The game started with 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. Nh3

A lot is going on in this position.  Let me start with the first four moves, until 2... e5, which marks the beginning of the Budapest Defense.
White's first 2 moves are 1. d4 and 2. c4, attempting to control the center of the board. However, this move forces white to weaken his d4 pawn and contest the center, allowing for an interesting tactical game.  After 3. dxe5 Ng4, black threatens to regain his lost pawn, and white must respond to him.
