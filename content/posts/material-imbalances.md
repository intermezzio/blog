It's been a while since I've posted, and I have a lot of interesting games to share. About a month ago, I competed at the US Amateur Team East tournament with some friends from my school. Shout out to my friends Aditya, Abhinav, and Justin for competing at the tournamnet with me! In the second round, I faced a 2100 (compared to my 1500 rating at the time), and the game was very intense.

I started with my typical Nimzo-Larsen Attack, and the opening was fairly normal.

Black has a slight advantage here, although it's about equal. Both sides have comfortable development, although my knight on b1 makes me too slow to take the c file - I will have to cede that to black.

Now, things are starting to get interesting. The center is closed off to both fianchettoed bishops, and my opponent and I are racing to see what can happen first: will I put enough pressure on d5, or the center of the board, making threats on the queenside after Nb4 and Qb5, or will my opponent break through after tripling on the c file? As the tension builds up, it is apparent that no moves can be wasted. Just one move can tip the balance in the opponent's favor.

This is the climax of the game: every single piece on the board is somehow involved in the pressure. Black has prepared to charge straight down the c file and white has put pressure on d4 and a4, two targets that can't be defended simultaneously. Despite all of this action, Stockfish evaluates this position as completely equal. When I was playing the game, I did not realize that this was equal, and thought that I might have an advantage after everything explodes on the board. Being the much lower rated player in the match, though, I suspected that there was something the 2100 could do that I hadn't considered. Nevertheless, there was no turning back, and after 20.Nxd5, I let the board explode.

Wow. After white captured in the center and black broke through the c file, the material ended up being equal. I have a queen and two pawns for a bishop, knight, and rook. Although most players would prefer the three pieces against a queen, Stockfish states that this is a dead draw.
